I had joined a Mainframe organization having its branch at Nungambakkam - Khadarnawaz Khan road.\n\nI have stayed at various places, during this timeframe in Chennai starting with Ranganathan Street T Nagar, Kilpauk, Anna Nagar East and West, Choolaimedu, Perungdi, VadaPalani, etc.\n\nI remember traveling in Dev Anand style local busses (driven tilted on one side as heavily stuffed with humans) from home to office and back. It was lovely adventure every day. \n\nMy liking for south India food increased during my stay in Chennai. It was a great time staying in Chennai. There are great memories of Chennai that I will cherish throughout my life- Chettinadu food, OMR, Besant nagar beach, my first bike- Samurai, Mahabalipuram, Puducherry, and the list will not end.\n\nNamma Chennai!!!"

During my childhood I travelled with my dad all around the country, but we never got a chance to visit Chennai. Post joining Infocepts I did visit Chennai, but they were brief visits and did not give me a chance to experience the city.\n\nThis year, I moved to Chennai for a few months and got a chance to really experience living in the city. It is a beautiful city which is a perfect mix of modern and traditional. The weather isnâ€™t as bad as people make it sound ðŸ˜Š I loved the Burmese street food and binged on Banga ðŸ˜Š\n\nBut what really set Chennai apart for me are the warm, loving and helpful people. I experienced a level of dedication and professionalism that is amazing. People are passionate and take pride in what they do. \n\nThe city truly is an Emotion!"

Itâ€™s a place where life never slows downâ€”whether itâ€™s the bustling streets, the passion for sports, or the irresistible aromas of street food. Growing up here has been a beautiful experience, filled with memories that will stay with me forever.\n\nFor me, North Chennai was all about cricket and football during my teenage years. I spent countless hours playing matches and tournaments with friends, and those days were filled with happiness and fun. Now, when I meet those same friends, our conversations often drift back to the days we spent on the cricket ground, reliving the joy of every victory and the thrill of every game.\n\nFifteen years ago, North Chennai had a different kind of magic during Diwali. Kite flying was a tradition that everyone took part in, and it was my favourite part of the festival. While most kids would ask their parents for new clothes or crackers, I would eagerly wait for the money to buy kites and thread. The sky would be filled with vibrant kites, and the entire neighbourhood would be out, competing and enjoying the festivities. Sadly, kite flying has now been banned for safety reasons, but looking back, I cherish those carefree days. And honestly, I think itâ€™s for the best that the ban was put in placeâ€”it keeps the public safe.\n\nMovies and music have always been part of North Chennaiâ€™s culture. When I was a kid, the streets echoed with MGR songs, and I grew up listening to his music blaring from loudspeakers. There wasâ€”and still isâ€”an immense love for cinema here, and MGR was an icon for the people. His songs remind me of the warmth and togetherness of my childhood days.\n\nOf course, no mention of North Chennai would be complete without talking about the food. Itâ€™s famous for its Burma food and seafood, offering flavours you wonâ€™t find anywhere else. And then thereâ€™s Kunhiraman juice shopâ€”a legend in itself. Itâ€™s been around for nearly 100 years, serving the best juices in the area. These little things, like grabbing a juice from Kunhiraman after a long day, are what make North Chennai so special to me.\n\nNo matter how much the city changes, North Chennai will always be where my heart belongs."

    "post": "Although Chennai has many famous spots, places like T Nagar and Parryâ€™s Corner feel overwhelmingly crowded and chaotic. Marina Beach, while iconic, could be cleaner and better maintained. Even the food scene disappointed me in some waysâ€”many restaurants charge exorbitantly for average meals, and the street food quality isnâ€™t always reliable. I wish Chennai could address these issues."
